# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0
### app.heatmap.njy folder

The app.heatmap.njy directory contains the app files for the part of animation using heatmap in the Shiny App, including global.R, server.R, ui.r three files altogether.

The heatmap is to show the user with the information about the places where some kind of crime might occur more often than other places and the intensity there as time goes by. The heatmap could also be a animation if clicked on the action button.
The user could choose the type of crime that they would like to take a look at. They could also choose the year they want. The heatmap is defaulted to be shown the animation of heatmap by one year. If the user click on the year button and right drag it to another year, it could show the heatmap for information within all those years.
